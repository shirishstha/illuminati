        The Suping Army Campus was established during the tenure of General Singha Pratap Shah, then Chief of Army Staff (COAS).
        In 1986, the campus was relocated to Sallaghari, Bhaktapur, where it was renamed Birendra Sainik Awasiya Mahavidyalaya after King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah. Since then, the funding of the school has been looked after by Nepal Army Welfare Fund. The institution is controlled administratively by the Nepal Army Headquarters and academically by teachers and professors. The highest officer from the military to administer SAMB is a Lt. Colonel who acts as a liaison officer.
